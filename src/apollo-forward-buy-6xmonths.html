                This example shows a widget where the Client needs to send funds so that the beneficiary recieves the same amount in their local currency every month.

                Every month the amount that is sent in the source currency may vary.
                The "Offered Price" is the amount that can be locked in today.
                There are also estaimates of a low and high forecast amounts using statitcal historic data. 
                These estimates are indicative only because past behaviour cannot predict future movements.
