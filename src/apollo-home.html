          <p>
              Apollo is an examplar of a Partner site that might wish to use the OpenHedge service.
              The content of this site is deliberately simplistic reflecting some probable use-cases.
              The examples have the most basic and minimalistic usage of HTML, CSS and Javascript purely to focus attention on the functionality 
              rather than styling or current trends/best practices in User Experience design.
              The examples are not to be used for as as templates for Production code. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The full source code to the Apollo examples is available in
