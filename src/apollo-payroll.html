            <p>
                This example is for a ficticious Professional Employer Organisation 
                where there is a team of people that need to be paid a fixed monthly amount in a foreign currency.
                <br>
                The example shows the "forward" amounts in the sending currency that could be locked in and
                be paid on the first of every month for the next 6 months.

            <h2>Professional Employer Organisations</h2>
            <p>
            Professional Employer Organisations (PEOs) play an increasingly important role servicing this growing trend. 
            From Employer of Record services, to recruitment, to statutory filings, 
            businesses require specialist HR assistance. 
            This ensures that teams in new jurisdictions are brought into the business efficiently and compensated as agreed. 
            For the corporate, at the very least it means legal compliance and all necessary protections. 
            Central to the PEO's list of services is HR Operations. 
            This includes important aspects such as onboarding, redundancies, benefits and expenses. 
            However, payroll services is usually the key requirement. 
            Managing a multi-country workforce of employees, 
            contractors and service providers without the oversight of a PEO would quickly topple the economic benefits of such practices. 
            </p>

            <p>
              PEOs offer corporate customers a range of payroll services from invoicing through to complete solutions. 
              <br>For example: 
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      PEO periodically provides a list of payment instructions to client 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      PEO invoices kind for total payroll and distributes monies in local currencies 
                  </li>
              </ul>
              These multicurrency payments are made by the corporate periodically over time 
              and are therefore means space susceptible to movements in currency prices.
